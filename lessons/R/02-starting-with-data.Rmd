# Data Carpentry R materials

--------------------------------------------------

# Motivations for this lesson

* Its really important that you know what you did. More journals/grants/etc. are also making it important for them to know what you did.
* A lot of scientific code is NOT reproducible.
* If you keep a lab notebook, why are we not as careful with our code.
* We edit each others manuscripts, but we don't edit each other's code.
* If you write your code with "future you" in mind, you will save yourself and others a lot of time.

# Presentation of RStudio

Let's start by learning about our tool.

_Point out the different windows in R._

* Console, Scripts, Environments, Plots
* Avoid using shortcuts.
* Code and workflow is more reproducible if we can document everything that we do.
* Our end goal is not just to "do stuff" but to do it in a way that anyone can easily and exactly replicate our workflow and results.

# Before we get started

* Start RStudio (presentation of RStudio -above- should happen here)
* Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `Empty project`
* Enter a name for this new folder, and choose a convenient location for
  it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day
  (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`)
* Click on "Create project"
* Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
  create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory.
  (e.g., `~/data-carpentry/data`)
* Create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working
  directory (e.g. `data-carpentry-script.R`)

Your working directory should now look like this:

# Basics of R

R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language that's useful both for statistics but also data science. Inspired by the programming language S.

* Open source software under GPL.
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 5,000 user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and industry.
* Available on all platforms.
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.
* Is object oriented and functional.
* Large and growing community of peers.

## Commenting

Use `#` signs to comment. Comment liberally in your R scripts. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored by R.

## Assignment operator

`<-` is the assignment operator. Assigns values on the right to objects on the left. Mostly similar to `=` but not always. Learn to use `<-` as it is good programming practice. Using `=` in place of `<-` can lead to issues down the line.

`=` should only be used to specify the values of arguments in functions for instance `read.csv(file="data/some_data.csv")`.

## Good practices

There are two main ways of interacting with R: using the console or by using script files (plain text files that contain your code).

The recommended approach when working on a data analysis project is dubbed "the source code is real". The objects you are creating should be seen as disposable as they are the direct realization of your code. Every object in your analysis can be recreated from your code, and all steps are documented. Therefore, it is best to enter as little commands as possible in the R console. Instead, all code should be written in script files, and evaluated from there. The R console should be used to inspect objects, test a function or get help. With this approach, the `.Rhistory` file automatically created during your session should not be very useful.

Similarly, you should separate the original data (raw data) from intermediate datasets that you may create for the need of a particular analysis. For instance, you may want to create a `data/` directory within your working directory that stores the raw data, and have a `data_output/` directory for intermediate datasets and a `figure_output/` directory for the plots you will generate.


# Introduction to R

## Objectives
* Familiarize participants with R syntax
* Understand the concept of objects and assignment
* Understand the concept of vector and data types
* Understand how factors work
* Get exposed to a few functions

## The R syntax

_Start by showing an example of a script_
* Point to the different parts:
  - a function
  - the assignment operator `<-`
  - the `=` for arguments
  - the comments `#` and how they are used to document function and its content
  - the `$` operator
* Point to identation and consistency in spacing to improve clarity

![Example of a simple R script](../../img/r_starting_example_script.png)

## Creating objects

You can get output from R simply by typing in math in the console

```{r}
3 + 5
12/7
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign _values_ to _objects_. To create objects, we need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator `<-` and the value we want to give it:

```{r}
weight_kg <- 55
```

Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or `subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too long. They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid but `x2` is). There are some names that cannot be used because they represent the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, see [here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html) for a complete list). In general, even if it's allowed, it's best to not use other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`), in doubt check the help to see if the name is already in use. It's also best to avoid `.` as in `my.dataset`. It is also recommended to use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.

When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the name:

```{r}
(weight_kg <- 55)
weight_kg
```

Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. For instance, we may want to convert this weight in pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2 times the weight in kg):

```{r}
2.2 * weight_kg
```

We can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new one:


```{r}
weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg
```

This means that assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of other variables.  For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a variable.

```{r}
weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg
```

and then change `weight_kg` to 100.

```{r}
weight_kg <- 100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 200?

### Exercise

What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r}
mass <- 47.5          # mass?
age  <- 122           # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0    # mass?
age  <- age - 20      # age?
massIndex <- mass/age # massIndex?
```

## Vectors and data types

A vector is the most common and basic data structure in R, and is pretty much the workhorse of R. It's a group of values, mainly either numbers or characters. You can assign this list of values to a variable, just like you would for one item. For example we can create a vector of animal weights:

```{r}
weights <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weights
```

A vector can also contain characters:

```{r}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
```

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:

```{r}
length(weights)
length(animals)
```

`class()` indicates the class (the type of element) of an object:

```{r}
class(weights)
class(animals)
```

The function `str()` provides an overview of the object and the elements it contains. It is a really useful function when working with large and complex objects:

```{r}
str(weights)
str(animals)
```

You can add elements to your vector simply by using the `c()` function:

```{r}
weights <- c(weights, 90) # adding at the end
weights <- c(30, weights) # adding at the beginning
weights
```

What happens here is that we take the original vector `weights`, and we are adding another item first to the end of the other ones, and then another item at the beginning. We can do this over and over again to build a vector or a dataset. As we program, this may be useful to autoupdate results that we are collecting or calculating.

We just saw 2 of the 6 **data types** that R uses: `"character"` and `"numeric"`. The other 4 are:
* `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., `1+4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
* `"raw"` that we won't discuss further
* `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
* `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)

Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that are part of R. Other important ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`) and factors (`factor`). We will talk about `data.frame` soon but first we need to talk about `factor`.

### Factors

Factors are special vectors that represent categorical data. Factors can be ordered or unordered and are important for statistical analysis and for plotting.

Factors are stored as integers that have labels associated the unique integers. While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them like strings.

Once created factors can only contain a pre-defined set values, known as *levels*. By default, R always sorts *levels* in alphabetical order, so if you have a factor with 2 levels, for instance

```{r}
sex <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
```

R will assign `1` to the level `"female"` and `2` to the level `"male"` (because `f` comes before `m`). You can check this by using the function `levels()`, and check the number of levels using `nlevels()`:

```{r}
levels(sex)
nlevels(sex)
```

Sometimes, the order of the factors does not matter, other times you might want factors to be ordered (or ranked), because the order is meaningful or it is required by a particular type of analysis (e.g., low, medium, high).

```{r}
food <- factor(c("low", "high", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high"))
levels(food)
food <- factor(food, levels=c("low", "medium", "high"), ordered=TRUE)
levels(food)
```

In R's memory, these vectors of factors are represented by numbers 1, 2, 3. They are better than using simple integer labels because factors are what are called self describing: `"male"` and `"female"`" is more descriptive than `1`s and `2`s. Which is male? `1` or `2`? You wouldn't be able to tell with just integer data. Factors have this information built in. It is particularly helpful when there are many levels (like the species in our example data set), or when there is no additional metadata (for simple datasets, real datasets always have metadata, right?)

If you need to convert a factor to a character vector, simply use `as.character(x)`.

Converting a factor to a numeric vector is however a little trickier, and you have to go via a character vector. Compare:

```{r}
f <- factor(c(1,5,10,2))
as.numeric(f) ## wrong! and there will be no warnings...
as.numeric(as.character(f))
```

### Exercise

The function `table()` tabulates observations and can be used to create
bar plots quickly. For instance:

```{r}
exprmt <- factor(c("treat1", "treat2", "treat1", "treat3", "treat1", "control",
                   "control", "treat1", "treat2", "control", "treat3", "control"))
table(exprmt)
barplot(table(exprmt))
```

**Question** How can you recreate this plot but by having "control" being listed
last instead of first?

<!---
```{r}
exprmt <- factor(exprmt, levels=c("treat1", "treat2", "treat3", "control"))
barplot(table(exprmt))
```
--->

# Importing the survey data

## Objectives

We want to:
* load external data (CSV files) in memory using the survey table (`surveys.csv`) as an example
* understand its structure
  - understand the concept of a `data.frame`
  - understand the concept of `NA`
  - know how to access any element of a `data.frame`
* being able to generate summary statistics from the data
* calculate the average weight of the animals across all animals
* generate plot from the data using the average weights of the animals as an example

To do all that, we'll have to learn a little bit about programming.


## Presentation of the Survey Data

We are studying the species and weight of animals caught in plots in our study
area.  The dataset is stored as a `.csv` file: each row holds information for a
single animal, and the columns represent `survey_id` (represented as global
unique identifier, GUID), `month`, `day`, `year`, `plot` (represented as a
GUID), `species` (a 2 letter code, see the `species.csv` file for
correspondance), `sex` ("M" for males and "F" for females), `wgt` (the weight in
grams).

The first few rows of the survey dataset look like this:

    "3a15270e-09c7-47a3-ab2e-0ffcbda1f162","8","19","1977","b564c1fc-bd87-4525-92ee-8bb36928fc10","DM","M","40"
    "72ab0a58-4e6d-4aa7-b5c7-abb10d49c141","8","19","1977","a7498949-7b94-4f8e-b253-3e26bbf80710","DM","M","48"
    "a174df84-6bf3-42bb-8dae-be3fd45566a7","8","19","1977","7dcaddf5-d272-4b69-a49c-d4f3cf000084","DM","F","29"
    "3658f574-1f07-4601-b053-f8656cb731cf","8","19","1977","7dcaddf5-d272-4b69-a49c-d4f3cf000084","DM","F","46"
    "0d17daf5-df94-475a-b57f-8aea2477cee3","8","19","1977","a7498949-7b94-4f8e-b253-3e26bbf80710","DM","M","36"


To load our survey data, we need to locate the `surveys.csv` file. We will use `setwd()` to tell R to __set__ our __w__orking __d__irectory, in other words where to look for files and save outputs, and `read.csv()` to load into memory (as a `data.frame`) the content of the CSV file.

* [download the data file](https://github.com/datacarpentry/2014-09-29-iDigBio/raw/master/data/biology/surveys.csv)
* put it in directory "data" of your working directory for these exercises


```{r, eval=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv('data/surveys.csv')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
surveys <- read.csv('../../data/biology/surveys.csv')
```

This statement doesn't produce any output because assignment doesn't display anything. If we want to check that our data has been loaded, we can print the variable's value:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
surveys
```

Wow... that was a lot of output. At least it means the data loaded properly. Let's check the top (the first 6 lines) of this `data.frame` using the function `head()`:

```{r, results='show'}
head(surveys)
```

__At this point, make sure all participants have the data loaded__

Let's now check the __str__ucture of this `data.frame` in more details with the function `str()`:

```{r}
str(surveys)
```

_Show how to get this information from the "Environment" tab in RStudio._

### Exercise

Based on the output of `str(surveys)`, can you answer the following questions?

* What is the class of the object `surveys`?
* How many rows and how many columns are in this object?
* How many species have been recorded during these surveys?


## About `data.frame`

`data.frame` is the _de facto_ data structure for most tabular data and what we
use for statistics and plotting. They are a collection of vectors of identical
lengths (each representing a column), and each vector can be of a different data
type (e.g., characters, integers, factors). The `str()` function is useful to
inspect the data types of the columns.

<!---
Data frames can have additional attributes such as `rownames()`, which can be
useful for annotating data, like subject_id or sample_id. But most of the time
they are not used.
--->

`data.frame` can be created by the functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`, in
other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).

By default, `data.frame` converts (= coerces) columns that contain characters
(i.e., text) into the `factor` data type. Depending on what you want to do with
the data, you may want to keep these columns as `character`. To do so,
`read.csv()` and `read.table()` have an argument called `stringsAsFactors` which
you can set to `FALSE`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
some_data <- read.csv("data/some_file.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

<!--- talk about colClasses argument?  --->

You can also create `data.frame` manually with the function `data.frame()`. This
function can also take the argument `stringsAsFactors`. Compare the output of
these examples:

__Point to the difference between character and factor output with str()__

```{r}
example_data <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                           feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                           weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8))
str(example_data)
example_data <- data.frame(animal=c("dog", "cat", "sea cucumber", "sea urchin"),
                           feel=c("furry", "furry", "squishy", "spiny"),
                           weight=c(45, 8, 1.1, 0.8), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(example_data)
```

### Exercises

1. Can you predict the class for each of the columns in the following example?

   ```{r}
    country_climate <- data.frame(country=c("Canada", "Panama", "South Africa", "Australia"),
                                     climate=c("cold", "hot", "temperate", "hot/temperate"),
                                     temperature=c(10, 30, 18, "15"),
                                     north_hemisphere=c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE),
                                     has_placentals=c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, "FALSE"))
   ```

   Check your gueses using `str(country_climate)`. Are they what you expected?
   Why? why not?

   R coerces (when possible) to the data type that is the least common
   denominator and the easiest to coerce to.

1. There are a few mistakes in this hand crafted `data.frame`, can you spot and
   fix them? Don't hesitate to experiment!

   ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    author_book <- data.frame(author_first=c("Charles", "Ernst", "Theodosius"),
                                 author_last=c(Darwin, Mayr, Dobzhansky),
                                 year=c(1942, 1970))
   ```

## Indexing

If we want to get a single value from the data frame, we must provide an index
in square brackets, just as we do in math. For instance:

```{r, results='show'}
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
animals[c(3, 2)]
animals[2:4]
animals[c(1:3, 2:4)]
```

R indexes starting at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB, and R start
counting at 1, because that's what human beings have done for thousands of
years.  Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count
from 0 because that's simpler for computers to do.

`:` is a special function that creates numeric vectors of integer in increasing
or decreasing order, test `1:10` and `10:1` for instance. The function `seq()`
(for sequence) can create more complex patterns:

```{r}
seq(1, 10, by=2)
seq(1, 10, length.out=4)
seq(1, by=5, length.out=100)
seq(1, 8, by=3) # sequence stops to stay below upper limit
```

Our survey data is has rows and columns, if we want to extract some specific
data from it, we need to specify the "coordinates" we want from it. Row numbers
come first, followed by column numbers.

```{r}
surveys[1, 1]   # first element in the first column of the data frame
surveys[1, 6]   # first element in the 6th column
surveys[1:3, 7] # first three elements in the 7th column
surveys[3, ]    # the 3rd elements for all columns
surveys[, 8]    # the entire 8th column
head_surveys <- surveys[1:6, ] # surveys[1:6, ] is equivalent to head(surveys)
```

### Exercices

1. The function `nrow()` on a `data.frame` returns the number of rows. Use it,
   in conjuction with `seq()` to create a new `data.frame` called
   `surveys_by_10` that includes every 10th row of the survey data frame
   starting at row 10 (10, 20, 30, ...)

<!---
```{r}
surveys_by_10 <- surveys[seq(10, nrow(surveys), by=10), ]
```
--->

## Statistics on subsets of data

When analyzing data, though, we often want to look at partial statistics, such as the maximum value per species or the average value per plot.

One way to do this is to select the data we want to create a new temporary array, using the subset() function

Let's look at just the animals of species 'DO'

```{r}
speciesDO <- subset(dat, species == 'DO')
```

We could see in our table from before that 'DO' had 3027 species. Let's check to see if that's what we have by checking the number of rows

```{r}
nrow(speciesDO)
```

__EXERCISE__

Calculate the mean and standard deviation of just the DO species


1. If data holds our array of survey data, what does `data[3:3, 4:4]` produce?
What about `data[3:3, 4:1]`? Explain the results to the person sitting next to you


## Manipulating Data

Now that our data is in memory, we can start doing things with it.
First, let's ask what type of thing data refers to:

```{r}
class(dat)
str(dat)
summary(dat)
```

The class output tells us that data currently is a data.frame in R.

This is similar to a spreadsheet in excel, that many of us are familiar with using.

The str output tells us what columns there are and what type they are.

The summary output summarizes our columns and shows us the range of our values.




__Useful functions__

* `head()` - see first 6 rows
* `tail()` - see last 6 rows
* `dim()` - see dimensions
* `nrow()` - number of rows
* `ncol()` - number of columns
* `str()` - structure of each column
* `names()` - will list the names attribute for a data frame (or any object really), which gives the column names.
* A data frame is a special type of list where every element of the list has same length.

`str` output tells us the dimensions and the data types (int is integer) of each column.

We can see what its shape is like this:

```{r}
dim(dat)
nrow(dat)
ncol(dat)
```

This tells us that data has 35549 rows and 8 columns.

Let's look at the structure of the data again

```{r}
str(dat)
```

If we look at 'plot' it says it's an integer.
 $ plot     : int  2 3 2 7 3 1 2 1 1 6
and it is an integer, but in our case we want it to be a factor. Basically it's a category. We don't want to be able to do math with it. We want to be able to ask things about that category. So we're going to change it from an integer to a factor in our data frame.

```{r}
dat$plot <- as.factor(dat$plot)
```





## Calculating statistics

We've gotten our data in to R, so that we can do some analysis with it.
First, let's get a sense of our data
We might for instance want to know how many animals we trapped in each plot, or
how many of each species were caught.

We can look at just one column at a time in different ways. We can reference that
column by it's number

```{r}
# Look at the weight column, the 8th one
dat[,8]
```

or by its name
```{r}
# Look at the weight column, by its name wgt
dat$wgt
```

If you forget the column names, you can type

```{r}
colnames(dat)
```

or

```{r}
str(dat)
```

will show you the column names and the type of data in them

If we do this, we can see for instance that there are 48 species
Factor w/ 48 levels means there are 48 different versions of that factor


So, let's get a list of all the species. The 'unique' command tells us all the
unique names in that column.
```{r}
unique(dat$species)
```

Now let's see how many of each species we have
```{r}
table(dat$species)
```

We could even assign it to a variable and make it a data frame to make it easier to look at

```{r}
species_table <- as.data.frame(table(dat$species))
```

Maybe we also want to see how many animals were captured in each plot

```{r}
table(dat$plot)
```

Now we want to do some actual calculations with the data though. Let's calculate the average weight of all the animals. R has a lot of built in statistical functions, like mean, median, max, min


```{r}
mean(dat$wgt)
```

Hmm, we just get NA. That's because we don't have the weight for every animal
and it's recorded as NA when we don't. We can't do math on NA. Conveniently R
provides a function na.omit() that will omit NAs from your data.

How many animals would we omit. We can look at how many animals we have overall and subtract how many we have after the NAs are omitted.

Because data is in a vector, when we want to know how much of something we have
we ask how long it is with the length() function.

```{r}
length(dat$wgt)
```

```{r}
length(na.omit(dat$wgt))
```

We can then subtract those numbers

```{r}
length(dat$wgt) - length(na.omit(dat$wgt))
```

We can see we'll be omitting 3266 animals. Bummer, but not terrible when we've sampled over 35,000 animals.

Let's calculate their average weight

```{r}
mean(na.omit(dat$wgt))
```

It gets a little annoying to type na.omit(dat$wgt) each time we want to do the calculation, so we can actually create a new data frame with the rows that have
NA omitted with the complete.cases() command. Don't worry too much about this. You can google it to learn more about it if you need to use it.

```{r}
dat2 <- dat[complete.cases(dat$wgt),]
```


```{r}
mean(dat2$wgt)
```

__EXERCISES__

R has a bunch of handy statistical functions built in. Calculate the median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum weight. For bonus points calculate the standard error.

What if we need the maximum weight for all animals, or the average for each plot?
As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the operation across an axis:

To support this, in R we can use the `apply` or 'tapply' function:
tapply() takes a vector, so we'll use that

```{r}
help(tapply) #or ?apply
```

Apply allows us to repeat a function on all of the rows (1), columns (2), or both(1:2) of an array or matrix.

What if you wanted to now go on and calculate the average weight of each species.
You could do this one by one, but you can actually do it all at once with the tapply() function.

The format is

tapply(data_you_want_to_calculate, factor_to_sort_on, function)

```{r}
tapply(dat2$wgt, dat2$species, mean)
```

Now we can put all the means into a variable

```{r}
species_means <- tapply(dat2$wgt, dat2$species, mean)
```

We still get NAs. That's because of the way that R keeps track of NAs when
you're converting data frames. There are ways to get around that for the apply
function, but we can use the aggregate function instead, which we'll cover next.

### Challenge
1. Find the maximum and minimum values for weight for each species
2. Save these values to a varible.
3. What is the length of your new variable?

```{r}
species_max <- tapply(dat2$wgt, dat2$species, max)
species_min <- tapply(dat2$wgt, dat2$species, min)
length(species_max)
length(species_min)
```




Now that we have all this summary information, we can put it back together into a data frame that we can use for further analysis and plotting, provided they are the same length.


```{r}
d.summary = data.frame(species_means, species_min, species_max)
```

We can also do this with the aggregate function, which deals with the NA rows that we eliminated more nicely. This is a very useful function, and it puts the output in to a data frame rather than a list.
If you look at documentation for aggregate() there's a few different ways to write the function. This is one way.

The format is
aggregate(what-to-plot~what-you-want-it-sorted-by, data=the-dataset, function)

```{r}
mean_species <- aggregate(wgt~species, data=dat, mean)
```

Maybe we want to look at the data average per species per plot

```{r}
aggregate(wgt~species+plot, data=dat, mean)
```

Or we just want to look at the average of particular species in each plot. Then we can subset the data within the function

```{r}
aggregate(wgt~species+plot, data=subset(dat, species == "DO"), mean)
```

__EXERCISES__

1. Create a data frame with the standard deviation of weight for each species

```{r}
sd_species <- aggregate(wgt~species, data=dat, sd)
```


## Plotting
The mathematician Richard Hamming once said, "The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers," and the best way to develop insight is often to visualize data. Visualization deserves an entire lecture (or course) of its own, but we can explore a few features of R's base plotting package and ggplot2 here.

Lets use the average species data that we saved and plot it.

R has built in plotting functions

```{r}
barplot(mean_species$wgt, names.arg=mean_species$species)
```


The axis labels are too big though, so you can't see them all. Let's change that
```{r}
barplot(mean_species$wgt, names.arg=mean_species$species, cex.names=0.4)
```

and change the color

```{r}
barplot(mean_species$wgt, names.arg=mean_species$species, cex.names=0.4, col=c("blue"))
```


__EXERCISES__

1. Create a plot showing the standard deviation of the species data


```{r}
barplot(sd_species$wgt, names.arg=sd_species$species)
```

2. Calculate the average weight by plot id
```{r}
plot_mean <- aggregate(wgt~plot, data=dat, mean)
```

3. Plot the average weight by plot and make the bars red
```{r}
barplot(plot_mean$wgt, names.arg=plot_mean$species, col=c("red"))
```

There's lots of different ways to plot things. You can use
```{r}
help(barplot)
```
or search online

There's also a plotting package called ggplot that adds a lot of functionality. I'm not going to go through it, but you can see a gallery of what's possible for plotting with ggplot.

Basically, you can do almost anything, and you can spend infinite time refining it.

If you wanted to output this plot do a pdf rather than to the screen, you can
specify where you want the plot to go with the 'pdf' command. If you wanted
it to be a jpeg, you would set it as 'jpeg'

Be sure to add the 'dev.off()' command at the end.
That command makes it so that the plots go back to getting printed within R.
Otherwise every new plot you make will get printed to that pdf.

````{r}
pdf("R_plot.pdf")
barplot(mean_species$wgt, names.arg=mean_species$species, cex.names=0.4, col=c("blue"))
dev.off()
```

__Package management__

`install.packages("package-name")` will download a package from one of the CRAN mirrors assuming that a binary is available for your operating system. If you have not set a preferred CRAN mirror in your options(), then a menu will pop up asking you to choose a location.

Use `old.packages()` to list all your locally installed packages that are now out of date. `update.packages()` will update all packages in the known libraries interactively. This can take a while if you haven't done it recently. To update everything without any user intervention, use the `ask = FALSE` argument.

In RStudio, you can also do package management through Tools -> Install Packages.

Updating packages can sometimes make changes, so if you already have a lot of code in R, don't run this now. Otherwise let's just go ahead and update our pacakges so things are up to date.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```


### Objectives
* Explain what a library is, and what libraries are used for.
* Load an R library and use the things it contains.
* Read tabular data from a file into a program.
* Assign values to variables.
* Learn about data types
* Select individual values and subsections from data.
* Perform operations on arrays of data.
* Display simple graphs.

## Loading Data
----------------

Words are useful, but what's more useful are the sentences and stories we use them to build.
Similarly, while a lot of powerful tools are built into languages like R,
even more lives in the libraries they are used to build.
Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker
and setting it up on the bench.
Once it's done, we can ask the library to do things for us.


## Key Points

* Import a library into a program using library libraryname.
* What are the data types in R?
* Use `variable = value` to assign a value to a variable in order to record it in memory.
* Variables are created on demand whenever a value is assigned to them.
* Use print something to display the value of something.
* The expression `dim()` gives the dimensions of a data frame or matrix.
* Use `object[x, y]` to select a single element from an array.
* Array indices start at 1.
* Use low:high to specify a slice that includes the indices from low to high.
* Use # some kind of explanation to add comments to programs.
* Use `mean()`, `max()`, `min()` and `sd()` to calculate simple statistics.
* Update vectors using append
* Use base R and the `ggplot2` library for creating simple visualizations.
